# AI Attribution and Development Process

## Overview

This project template was developed through a collaborative process between human project management and AI assistance, specifically using Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic through the [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) platform.

## Development Methodology

### Human Contributions (Jp Cruz)
- **Strategic Vision**: Defined the need for a secure, comprehensive project template
- **Requirements Analysis**: Specified security, automation, and documentation needs
- **Quality Oversight**: Reviewed all generated code for security and best practices
- **Decision Making**: Made final decisions on architecture, tools, and implementation approaches
- **Testing Strategy**: Designed validation approaches and audit criteria
- **Project Management**: Guided the development process and prioritized features

### AI Contributions (Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Anthropic)
- **Code Generation**: Generated shell scripts, configuration files, and documentation
- **Best Practices Research**: Analyzed current industry standards and security practices
- **Implementation Details**: Provided technical implementation of security features
- **Documentation Creation**: Drafted comprehensive documentation and guides
- **Code Review**: Performed security analysis and vulnerability assessments
- **Automation Scripts**: Created audit and validation scripts

## Development Process

1. **Collaborative Planning**: Human defined objectives, AI provided technical insights
2. **Iterative Development**: Human provided feedback, AI refined implementations
3. **Security Focus**: Both human and AI prioritized security-first approach
4. **Quality Assurance**: Human oversight ensured all code met security standards
5. **Documentation**: AI generated documentation under human editorial guidance

## AI Tool Details
